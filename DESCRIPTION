Authors@R: 
    person("Cathal", "Byrne", email = "cathal.byrne@cso.ie", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a unified interface for working with local data infrastructure.
    Supports two storage backends: a hive-partitioned parquet lake (similar to 
    existing SAS storage) and DuckLake (with time travel capabilities). Facilitates
    data sharing between sections with built-in governance, access control via
    file system permissions, and dataset publishing workflows.
